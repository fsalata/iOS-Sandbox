# Swift String Cheat Sheet

 The Swift String API is [hard](https://www.mikeash.com/pyblog/friday-qa-2015-11-06-why-is-swifts-string-api-so-hard.html) to get used to. It has also changed over time as the Swift language and the standard library have developed. I first wrote this guide for Swift 2 and have since needed to update it for Swift 3, 4 and now Swift 5. So for my future reference and yours if you are struggling to make sense of it all here is my Swift String Cheat Sheet.

The blog post that accompanies this playground:

You can get the latest version of the Xcode playground from my GitHub repository:
